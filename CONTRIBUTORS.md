# RC Coffee Chats Contributors

The original prototype began during Sheridan's batch in fall 2018. The original project can be found on glitch [here](https://glitch.com/~zulip-coffee-bot). Alan Chu has been leading the work on the newer version.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, provided feature ideas, helped
answer questions, participated in code reviews, and generally made the app that
much better (listed alphabetically by first name):

* [Alan Chu] (https://github.com/thechutrain)
* [Greg Altman] (https://github.com/fewf)
* [John Paul Ashenfelter](https://github.com/johnpaulashenfelter)
* [Liz Krane] (https://github.com/LearningNerd)
