# Coffee Chats 2.0
> Zulip bot that pairs Recursers for coffee chats

## Signing up  
Message the @chat-bot directly.

~~If you're looking to get paired for coffeechats you can subscribe to the coffee chat stream.~~

## Installing

Before you get started, make sure you have:

* a recent version of Node (10.x) 
* some version of SQLite3
* Python 2.7 (any recent version)

The `better-sqlite3` npm package requires Python 2 as a dependency. Python 3 will through a syntax error. Things get even more complicated on Windows. Just make sure you can run Python 2.7 from the CLI.

The basic installation is what you'd expect: `npm install`.

After all of the `npm` packages have been installed, you'll want to create a `.env` file, probably by copying the example file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You can configure it as you wish, but the default values should just work. The default database is `data/development.db` which is already configured in the `.env` file. To create it (since we're avoiding checking it in through our `.gitignore`), you just need to touch the file:

```
touch data/development.db
```

Once you've installed all the packages, copied the local environment file, and created the development database, you can run the tests to verify everything works:

```
npm test
```

and then start the server

```
npm run dev
```

Happy hacking!

## Goals
The current goal has now been to make Coffee Chat more robust and extendable so it can be easily maintained and additional features can be added. These goals include the following:

* decoupling the code into separate modules
* writing tests to ensure there are no regression bugs
* Using TypeScript for type safety and documentation
